## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For writing more explicit and reliable code
- [useSWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) - For making data handling fast, efficient, and simple
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) - For formatting date strings
- Lambdas (Serverless functions)
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Modules & CSS-in-JS
- Mobile-first design & workflow
- React hooks

### What I learned

My goal for this project was to build my Next.js chops while also trying out a few patterns and libraries I haven't worked with before like CSS Modules, [useSWR](https://swr.vercel.app/), and [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/).

Making use of [useSWR](https://swr.vercel.app/), was very enjoyable. It made setting up requests from the UI super easy. I can see myself using this again in other projects.

### Continued development

While I've implemented the ability to load more jobs indefinitely, I should still improve performance by limiting the amount of rendered items on screen. I would 
also like to add a dark mode option to the application.
